    <h2>About Witch’s Hat</h2>
    <p>
      The Witch’s Hat is an online art catalog dedicated to the strange, the beautiful, and the quietly enchanted.
      Founded on the belief that art should feel like stepping into another world,
      our catalog gathers works that spark curiosity, celebrate imagination, and honor the artists who create them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our name comes from the symbol of the witch’s hat itself, a marker of intuition,
      creativity, and the courage to see the world differently.
      We embrace that philosophy in the pieces we curate and the stories we tell.
      Whether it’s contemporary illustration, surreal photography, or traditional craft, each work featured here
      is chosen for its ability to cast a spell, subtle or spectacular, on its viewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At The Witch’s Hat, we aim to make discovery effortless and inspiration inevitable.
      Our platform exists not only to showcase artists, but to create a space where art lovers can wander, wonder,
      and connect with works that speak to their inner worlds.
    </p>
    <p>Step inside. Stay a while. Let yourself be enchanted.</p>
